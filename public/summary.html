<p>
    Hey there - I'm Stacy - I'm 42 and just discovering the freedom of enjoying my life!
</p>
    A little over a year ago I married my best friend and made the incredible decision to uproot my life 
    in the United States and move to my husband's home, Germany.  I even brought my furbaby with me, a Siberian
    Husky named, <a href="../assets/baldr.png">Baldr</a>  It was such an insane move, but fortunately things are 
    finally settling down for us.
</p>
<p>
    Since moving from the U.S. I've rediscovered my interest in HTML and web development.  I've been devoting time
    to relearning the basics and I'm looking forward to furthering my knowledge.  Better late than never!
