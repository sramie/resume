    <li>Collecting Comics
        <p>
            My favorite comics revolve around the X-Men.  I've been collecting since I was nine years old
            and it was a special bonding I had between myself and my father.  I have probably an unhealthy
            amount of X-Men knowledge taking up space in my brain, but I can't help it - I love the stories
            and art!

    <li>Gaming
        <p>
            My gaming career began back in the days of Atari and only flourished after my parants bought my sister
            and me our first Nintendo.  I've since graduated from console play to more PC gaming and I've even gone
            so far as to build my own rig for gaming.  It's hard for me to narrow down a favorite game because
            the industry is constantly making leaps, but I enjoy puzzle games, rpgs, shooters, anything with a great
            story really.

    <li>Learning German
        <p>
            Since the time I realized there was a good chance I would make a future move to Germany, I began learning
            the language.  It's been challenging, especially since I'm an English native, but I wouldn't call it 
            impossible.  I love finding similarities between both languages now and I have a great partner to
            practice with.

    <li>Pathfinder/D&D
        <p>
            I suppose I could have listed this under gaming, but I feel table top gaming requires its own category.
            I absolutely adore the problem solving, team work, and creativity that goes into playing and/or DMing a game.

    <li>3D Printing
        <p>
            This is a fairly new hobby for me as I've recently dipped my toes into the world of model printing.
            I'm currently running a Elegoo Mars 3 with the Elegoo Mercury X Washing and Curing Station.  I've
            enjoyed troubleshooting the machines and teaching myself the different slicing programs associated 
            with them.  I'm really looking forward to getting more involved with the CAD programs.
